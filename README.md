# Eros-EH+

English | [简体中文](README_cn.md)

## Introduction

An unofficial [e-hentai](https://e-hentai.org) / [exhentai](https://exhentai.org) client built with Flutter.

This is a **personal fork** of [erosTeam/eros_fe](https://github.com/erosTeam/eros_fe), rebranded as **Eros-EH+** (`com.ldwdg.erosehentai`, v2.0.0).

## What's New in This Fork

- **Rebranded**: app name `Eros-EH+`, Android package `com.ldwdg.erosehentai`, version `2.0.0+567`
- **Removed** sentry_flutter (error reporting) and system_network_proxy (broken Linux plugin) — desktop proxy now reads `http_proxy`/`HTTPS_PROXY` env vars
- **Isar** upgraded to 3.3.0 stable (compatible with Ubuntu 22.04 / glibc 2.35)
- **Linux desktop support** added (upstream only shipped android/ios/macos/windows)
- **Bug fixes**:
  - ExHentai thumbnail redirect to ehgt.org not working (upstream issue #17) — regex rewritten for current URL format
  - Home page parser crash when not logged in
- `lib/config/config.dart` maintained locally as plaintext (upstream git-crypt encrypted file cannot compile without key)

## Build

Requirements: Flutter stable (3.44.8+), Dart 3.12+

```bash
# 1. Prepare local config
cp lib/config/config.dart.sample lib/config/config.dart
#    (edit it with your own credentials if needed; it is gitignored)

# 2. Get dependencies (China mirror optional)
flutter pub get

# 3a. Run on Linux desktop
flutter run -d linux
#     requires: clang cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgtk-3-dev liblzma-dev

# 3b. Build Android release APK (signed)
flutter build apk --release
#     output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk
```

> Note: upstream README mentions `firebase_options.dart` — it is no longer required in this fork.
